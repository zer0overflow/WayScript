# What is this?
 Simple WayScript development for Amazon Alexa. Hello I recently started with WayScript development and this is my project. I am an amatuer developer, so please don't 
 judge my code. Have a great day!
# How to
 Make sure this program `power.py` is running. Python3 is recomended and I think maybe it'll work with other python versions. You can add the `power.py` to s a
startup directory so it can run on boot.
